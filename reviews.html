            <p>I want to thank Ismael for helping me buy my investment property. He made the process painless and super easy. He also was very attentive to all my questions and concerns about the whole process. Ismael was very knowledgeable and kind. </p>
            <p>I would definitely recommend him to everyone who is looking to purchase a home and as a bonus he is bilingual!! Spanish speakers can find comfort in knowing that all their questions will be resolved and understood.  Thank Ismael for your professionalism! I look forward to contacting you for my future purchases.</p>

            <p>I wanted to write a quick thank you to you for helping me sell my property. I am very impressed with the level of accessibility and responsiveness you gave me through the whole process and the experience you brought to the table. You are also personable and easy to work with which makes the process of selling a house a lot easier. </p>
            <p>Not many people go above and beyond what is necessary to get a job done but you definitely showed your dedication as a representative of not only your self but your company. </p>
            <p>I was extremely impressed with your connections and access to the items and needs of my property and really took the stress and guesswork out from inspections to fixing issues and helping to maximize potential and it shows, my property sold for over asking price! </p>
            <p>It was a pleasure having you represent me as a client and I thank you for your dedication and hard work, thanks again Ismael!</p>

            <p>Ismael Banuelos helped us to sell our house here at West Dublin.
                He was very professional and responsible for every part of the transaction.
                He shows human worth and respect.
                His knowledge of the market in our area gives us a sense of direction and gets us 10% over the asking price.I truly recomend Mr Ismael Banuelos.
                
                Sincerely.
                Laura Valencia.</p>

            <p>When my wife and I decided to find our dream home, we were lost. Enter Ismael—the compass that pointed us in the right direction. Step by step, he patiently walked us through the process.

                We didn’t even know about loan pre-approval letters until Ismael enlightened us. Armed with one, we discovered our dream home—a place where our future would unfold.
                
                Ismael, thank you for turning confusion into clarity. You’re not just a realtor; you’re our trusted guide.  </p>

            <p>Ismael and his partner Jim did an excellent job selling my house at 7625 Starwood in Dublin. Their creative preparation and staging of the entire property along with aggressive marketing resulted in earning me 20% over price. I enthusiastically recommend this dynamic duo!!</p>

            <p>Ismael is not the typical real estate agent that is desperate for you to choose a property and close as soon as possible. 
                
                </p>

                <p>He understands the customer needs and expectation, he actively works on finding the best possible match until he finds the perfect property for his customers, even if this process takes months. He will never put pressure on you to buy something you don’t fully like.</p>

                <p>His patience, dedication and professionalism are one of a kind and I will do business again with him without hesitation.
                    He puts his customers first and before anything else, and this is what makes the difference. He is nothing but an excellent real estate agent.</p>
